# Adds chapterã€€information to a repository

At nodeschool every chapter has a repo on github. You can become a chapter-maintainer by
signing up for it [here](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers#how-to-start-a-new-nodeschool-chapter).

After you have the repo this wizard guides you to add all the information necessary for your
chapter
