# Creates a new event.

Every chapter can have a `events.json` that contains a list of events of this particular chapter. In order to maintain a certain amount of sanity in the data structure, the events have to follow certain
data rules. 

This command makes it easier to add new events to the `events.json` that are valid. 

## Reuse of data

`create-event` will reuse previous event data such as the location and the name-prefix.

## Passing in data

You can prefill the event data using the following parameters

	- `--event-name`
	- `--event-location-name`
	- `--event-location-lat`
	- `--event-location-lng`
	- `--event-location-time-zone`
	- `--event-start-date` or `--event-date`
	- `--event-start-time`
	- `--event-end-date` or `--event-date`
	- `--event-end-time`
	- `--event-url`
