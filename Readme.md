# NodeSchool Chapter CLI Tool

Welcome to [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io)! `nodeschool-chapter` is a CLI tool that should help you run & setup your chapter. The CLI tool should make some things easier for you.

# Installation

` npm i nodeschool-chapter -g` 

# Usage

This tool works slightly different depending on what folder you run it in.

# Standard mode

The `Standard Mode` is active in every folder **except** folders that works for [`Chapter Mode`](#chapter-mode).

# Chapter Mode
 
To be in `Chapter Mode` you need to move your terminal location to a folder that contains a git repository with a [remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote) pointing to the repo of your nodeschool chapter.

The application will show a nice dialog to choose your commands from there on.

Cheers.
