### Project's Style
###### How to get along with others
- ***Please Write Comments*** - You don't need to comment every line though, but it helps everyone doing a code review understand what are you trying to accomplish in the PRs.
- We use the [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/rules.html) to have a consistent development style.
- (Suggestions welcome)

###### Suggestions
* Contributions are submitted, reviewed, and accepted using pull requests.
* The latest releases are in the master branch.
* Test before you make a Pull Request.
* ***Test before you make a Pull Request.***
* Keep it compatible. Try to not introduce breaking changes, (Although we know that sometimes those changes are a must)
```
npm run test
```

### In case you don't know how to create a PR.
I bet this is not the first time you are contributing to a Open Source Project (If it is, congrats and welcome!!).
Just in case you forgot, here is a quick 6 steps on how to do it.

- First, Fork the repo
- Clone the forked repo -> `git clone git@github.com:<your-user-name>/admin.git`
- Install dependencies -> `npm install`
- (Make sure the tests pass) -> `npm run test`
- Make your changes. Add tests for your changes. ***And make sure the tests pass*** -> `npm run test`
- Push to your fork and [***make a pull request***](https://github.com/nodeschool/admin/compare?expand=1)

#### In case of chaos/needed release/questions etc.
You can always reach out to [one of the maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/nodeschool/teams/admin-maintainer)
