## Project's Style

(_How to get along with others_)

- ***Please Write Comments*** - You don't need to comment every line though,
  but it helps everyone doing a code review understand what are you trying to
  accomplish in the PRs.
- We use the [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/rules.html) to
  have a consistent development style. We also use
  [Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) to make sure that
  the markdown files look pretty.

## Suggestions

- Contributions are submitted, reviewed, and accepted using pull requests.
- The latest releases are in the master branch.
- Test before you make a Pull Request.
- ***Test before you make a Pull Request.***
- Keep it compatible. Try to not introduce breaking changes, (Although we know
  that sometimes those changes are a must) `npm run test`
- (Further suggestions welcome)

## In case you don't know how to create a PR

I bet this is not the first time you are contributing to a Open Source Project
(If it is, congrats and welcome!!). Just in case you forgot, here is a quick 6
steps on how to do it.

- First, Fork the repo
- Clone the forked repo -> `git clone git@github.com:<your-user-name>/admin.git`
- Install dependencies -> `npm install`
- (Make sure the tests pass) -> `npm run test`
- Make your changes. Add tests for your changes.
  Please, also ***make sure the tests pass*** with `npm run test`
- Push to your fork and [***make a pull request***](https://github.com/nodeschool/admin/compare?expand=1)

### In case of chaos/needed release/questions/etc

You can always reach out to [one of the maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/nodeschool/teams/admin-maintainer)
